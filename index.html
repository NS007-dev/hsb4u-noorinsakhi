            <p><strong>What:</strong> Toxic masculinity refers to harmful social norms that suggest manhood is based on
                dominance, emotional suppression, and aggression.</p>

            <p><strong>When:</strong> These norms have existed for a long time, but they have evolved and spread more
                quickly
                through 21st-century social media.</p>

            <p><strong>Where:</strong> This issue exists globally, but it is especially visible in online spaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Why:</strong> These expectations are deeply rooted in patriarchal systems where control and
                toughness are
                rewarded, while vulnerability is often discouraged.</p>

            <p>
                In Canada, about 75% of suicide deaths are men (Canadian Psychological Association, n.d.).
                This points to a serious mental health issue that may be connected to rigid ideas about masculinity,
                especially the belief that men should hide their emotions. The American Psychological Association (2019)
                explains that men are less likely to seek psychological help because of stigma and the pressure to
                appear
                self-reliant.
                <br><br>
                BBC News (2023) has also reported concerns about the rise of online influencers who promote extreme or
                hyper-masculine ideas to young audiences. These statistics show that toxic masculinity is not just a
                social
                concept- it has real effects on mental health and behavior in society.
            </p>

    <section id="theory">
        <h2>The Social Theory</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <p>
                Using <strong>Conflict Theory</strong>, toxic masculinity can be seen as part of a system that keeps
                certain groups in
                power.
                Conflict theorists believe society is made up of groups competing for power, and the group with the most
                power
                often shapes social norms to benefit themselves. Traditional ideas about masculinity- like being
                dominant,
                emotionally tough, and in control - help maintain patriarchal systems where men are more likely to hold
                authority,
                while women and gender-diverse people are often disadvantaged.
                <br><br>
                This issue can also be explained using <strong>Socialization Theory</strong>. From a young age, many
                boys are taught
                that showing emotion is a weakness and that they should always appear strong. Over time, these messages
                become
                normal and influence how they see themselves and others.
                <br><br>
                So toxic masculinity is not just about individual choices - it is shaped by the messages people receive
                from media,
                schools, families, and especially social media. Real social change happens when these messages start to
                shift and
                society begins redefining strength as empathy, accountability, and emotional openness.

                In recent years, more people have started talking about the impact of rigid gender norms.
                Many schools are introducing social-emotional learning programs that teach students how to
                understand and express their emotions in healthy ways. Mental health campaigns are also
                encouraging men to seek support and helping reduce the stigma around therapy.
                <br><br>
                Governments and community organizations are creating programs focused on preventing
                gender-based violence and teaching media literacy so young people can think critically
                about harmful online content. Around the world, activists and educators are challenging
                traditional stereotypes and promoting healthier versions of masculinity based on respect,
                empathy, and accountability.
                <br><br>
                Addressing toxic masculinity is part of a bigger push toward equality and better mental
                health for everyone. When society redefines strength to include vulnerability and emotional
                awareness, it creates safer and more supportive communities.

            <h2>Be Part of the Change</h2>
            <p>
                Challenging harmful gender norms starts with everyday conversations and small changes in how we think
                about masculinity. It means encouraging boys and men to express emotions without feeling embarrassed
                and questioning stereotypes that limit how people are “supposed” to act.
                <br><br>
                Real change happens when we redefine strength - not as dominance or silence - but as empathy,
                respect, and emotional honesty.
