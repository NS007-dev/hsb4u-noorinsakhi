            <p>
                In Canada, approximately 75% of suicide deaths are men (Canadian Psychological Association, n.d.).
                This highlights a serious mental health crisis linked to rigid masculine norms that discourage
                emotional
                expression.
                The American Psychological Association (2019) reports that men are significantly less likely to seek
                psychological help due to stigma and expectations of self-reliance.
                Additionally, BBC News (2023) documents growing concern among educators about the rise of online
                hyper-masculine
                influencers who promote misogyny and dominance-based identity narratives.
                These statistics show that toxic masculinity is not just a cultural idea- it has significant
                psychological and social consequences.

        <h2>Applying Social Theory</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <p>
                Using <strong>Conflict Theory</strong>, toxic masculinity can be understood as a social structure that
                maintains power hierarchies. Conflict theorists argue that dominant groups preserve power by shaping
                cultural norms and institutions. Traditional masculine ideals - such as dominance, emotional
                suppression,
                and control - reinforce patriarchal systems that privilege men in authority while marginalizing women
                and gender-diverse individuals.
                <br><br>
                This issue can also be examined through <strong>Socialization Theory</strong>. From early childhood,
                boys are often rewarded for toughness and discouraged from expressing vulnerability. These learned
                behaviors become internalized and normalized, shaping identity and emotional development.
                <br><br>
                From these perspectives, toxic masculinity is not simply individual behavior; it is embedded in
                institutions such as media, education, family structures, and digital platforms. Social change
                occurs when these systems are challenged through activism, education reform, policy development,
                and shifts in cultural narratives about what it means to be “strong.”

            <p>
                Public awareness surrounding rigid gender norms has grown significantly in recent years.
                Schools are implementing social-emotional learning (SEL) programs that teach emotional literacy,
                empathy, and healthy coping strategies. Mental health campaigns are working to reduce stigma
                around men seeking therapy and promote open conversations about vulnerability.
                <br><br>
                Governments and non-profit organizations are investing in gender-based violence prevention programs
                and digital literacy initiatives that help young people critically evaluate harmful online content.
                On a global level, advocacy movements are challenging traditional gender stereotypes and promoting
                healthier models of masculinity centered on respect and accountability.
                <br><br>
                Addressing toxic masculinity connects to the larger goals of social equity, improved mental health
                outcomes, and safer communities. The broader significance lies in reshaping cultural expectations so
                that identity is not constrained by harmful norms but supported through inclusivity and emotional
                well-being.
